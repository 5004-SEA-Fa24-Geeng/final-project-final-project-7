# Project Proposal

- What are you building?
  - Our project is a Mariners baseball game simulator. It allows the user to view different MLB teams, their associated team
    and player stats, choose a player lineup for the Mariners, and simulate a game played against another team. The simulated game
    incorporates real MLB statistics to determine the average outcome of a series of simulations for the given teams.
- What are the initial features for the application?
  - Initial features for the application include:
    - Ability to sort/filter Mariners players based on different stats
    - Ability to build a player lineup
    - Ability to select an opposing MLB team to play against
    - Ability to run simulations of games with the given player lineup
    - > [!NOTE] This will be terminal application and all view components will take the form of a text user interface.
- What are the _minimum_ additional features you plan to implement?
  - Ability to select pitcher roster for opposing team.
  - Ability to export simulation results.
- What are your stretch goals (features beyond the minimum)?
  - Ability to select a number of simulations to run and average.
  - Ability to arbitrarily select any MLB team lineup and team combination.
- Go over your initial design.
  - See [Initial Design](./InitialDesign.md)
- How do you plan to break up the work?
  - Derek will handle Controller and View implementation and testing.
  - ShangRu and Huang-Shou will handle Model and business logic implementation and testing.
- What is your teams timeline and major check-in points?
  - April 2: Complete design and product roadmap
  - April 10: Minimum viable product complete with initial features implemented and tested
  - April 12: Project sync
  - April 15: Project demonstration
