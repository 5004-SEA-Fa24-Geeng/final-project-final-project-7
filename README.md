## MLB Simulator

- This application simulates baseball games by allowing the user to select a batting lineup for the Seattle Mariners to compete against other MLB teams.
- The simulation is based on the statistical profiles of the players involved, creating realistic game outcomes.


## Documentation

- [UML Diagram](./DesignDocuments/InitialDesign.md)

## Instructions

To run the application, simply execute the MLBSimulator file. You'll be presented with a command-line interface where you can enter various commands to build your team and run simulations. You need to pick 9 batters and 3 pitchers to play the simulation. 
To start building lineup for player team, you can explore the available batters using filtering options. Filter players can base on key statistics like AVG, OPS and other metrics. Next, add your preferred batters to create a lineup.

For the computer team, you can browse all the opponent teams, and select one team to see available pitchers. Now, you can choose three pitchers from the selected team to face your lineup!

### Example Workflow

1. Browse available batters with command line: `player show all`
2. Filter batter for OBP and sort with OPS with command line: `player filter OBP >= 0.380 sort OPS`
3. Add 9 players to your lineup with command line: `player add Juan Soto`
4. View your current lineup with command line: `player show lineup`
5. Exploring all computer team with command line: `computer show teams`
6. Select a computer team with command line: `computer select dodgers`
7. View available pitchers with command line: `computer show dodgers`
8. Filter pitcher for rotation and sort with strikes with command line: `computer filter rotation == 1 sort strikes`
9. Add 1 starter and 2 relievers to the pitcher lineup with command line: `computer add Clayton Kershaw to 1`
10. Run a simulation with command line: `simulate`
11. Run multiple simulations to a file with command line: `simulate -n 5-o results.txt`


### Player Team Commands
The following commands allow you to manage your batter lineup:

`player show [name]` - Display detail information for a specific batter

`player show lineup` - View your current batting lineup

`player show all` - Browse all available batters in the player pool

`player show attributes` - Show filterable attributes

`player add [name]` - Add a batter to your team by typing the batter name

`player clear` - Reset your batter lineup

`player filter [filters] sort [attribute]` - Filter and sort the player roster based on specific criteria. Example: player filter TotalPA >= 100 sort AVG >= 0.25

`player remove [name]` - Remove a batter from your team

`player filter reset` - Clear current filter

### Computer Team Commands

`computer show [team]` - Display available pitchers for a specific MLB team

`computer show [name]` - Show pitcher information for the selected pitcher

`computer show lineup` - Show current lineup for computer

`computer show teams` - List all selectable MLB teams

`computer show attributes` - Show filterable attributes

`computer select [team]` - Choose a team to select the computer team

`computer add [name/number] to [pos]` - Add a pitcher to a specific position in the rotation. Example: computer add Carlos Rodon to 1 or computer add 12 to 1

`computer filter [filters] sort [attribute]` - Filter and sort player roster. Example: computer filter rotation == 1 sort strikes

`computer remove [name/number/range]` - Remove pitchers from the rotation. Example: computer remove Carlos Rod√≥n, 1-3, all

`computer filter reset` - Clear current filter

### Other Commands

`help` - Display the help message with all available commands

`simulate -n [number] -o [outfile]` - Run [number] game simulations and write to file [outfile]. If no options are provided, 1 simulation will be run and printed to console.

`-n [number]`: Specify the number of simulations to run (default: 1)

`-o [outfile]`: Write results to a txt file

`exit` - Exit the application

### Player filter Information Metrics
Fastball Statistics

- fastballPA: Plate appearances against fastball pitches
- fastballH: Hits against fastball pitches
- fastball1B: Singles against fastball pitches
- fastball2B: Doubles against fastball pitches
- fastball3B: Triples against fastball pitches
- fastballHR: Home runs against fastball pitches
- fourSeam: A straight, hard pitch with backspin that appears to rise
- twoSeam - A fastball with movement that typically runs in toward same-handed batters
- cutter - A fastball that slightly breaks away from the pitcher's arm side, often breaking bats
- sinker - A fastball with significant downward movement, designed to induce ground balls

Breaking Statistics

- breakingPA: Plate appearances against breaking pitches (sliders, curveballs, etc.)
- breakingH: Hits against breaking pitches
- breaking1B: Singles against breaking pitches
- breaking2B: Doubles against breaking pitches
- breaking3B: Triples against breaking pitches
- breakingHR: Home runs against breaking pitches
- slider: A breaking pitch with horizontal and vertical movement, faster than a curveball
- curve: A breaking pitch with significant downward movement due to topspin
- knuckle: A pitch thrown with minimal spin causing unpredictable movement
- sweeper: A breaking pitch similar to a slider but with more horizontal break across the strike zone
- slurve: A hybrid pitch combining characteristics of a slider and a curveball

Offspeed Statistics

- offspeedPA: Plate appearances against off-speed pitches (changeups, splitters, etc.)
- offspeedH: Hits against off-speed pitches
- offspeed1B: Singles against off-speed pitches
- offspeed2B: Doubles against off-speed pitches
- offspeed3B: Triples against off-speed pitches
- offspeedHR: Home runs against off-speed pitches
- splitFinger: Looks like a fastball but drops suddenly as it reaches the plate
- changeUp - A slower pitch thrown with similar arm action to a fastball, designed to disrupt timing
- fork - Similar to a split-finger but with fingers spread wider and more downward movement
- screw - A pitch that breaks in the opposite direction of a curveball

Total Performance Metrics

- totalPA: Total plate appearances across all pitch types
- totalH: Total hits across all pitch types
- total1B: Total singles across all pitch types
- total2B: Total doubles across all pitch types
- total3B: Total triples across all pitch types
- totalHR: Total home runs across all pitch types

Plate Discipline Metrics

- zoneSwing: Percentage of swings on pitches in the strike zone
- zoneContact: Percentage of contact made on swings at pitches in the strike zone
- chaseSwing: Percentage of swings on pitches outside the strike zone (chase rate)
- chaseContact: Percentage of contact made on swings at pitches outside the strike zone

Traditional Statistics

- AVG: Batting average (hits divided by at-bats)
- OBP: On-base percentage (times reached base divided by plate appearances)
- OPS: On-base plus slugging (combines OBP and slugging percentage)
- Rotation: The pitcher's role in the team's pitching staff (e.g., 1 = starting pitcher, 2 = relief pitcher)
- Strikes: The total number of strikes thrown by the pitcher
- Pitches: The total number of pitches thrown by the pitcher
- StrikesRate: The percentage of pitches that are thrown as strikes
- BallsRate: The percentage of pitches that are thrown as balls (not in the strike zone)
